## Project Overview
This project is for my Final Year Project called "Amplifying Womenâ€™s Voices: AI-Driven Sentiment Analysis in STEM Communities Using Reddit". This project aims to uncover biases in online communities, such as reddit, using pre-trained ML models such as BERT.

## Features
- **Feature 1: Data Preprocessing**  
    - **File:** `preprocess.py`  
        This script handles the preprocessing of raw Reddit data, including cleaning, tokenization, and formatting for input into machine learning models.

- **Feature 2: Model Comparison**  
    - **File:** `compare-models-script.py`  
        This script compares the performance of different pre-trained models, such as BERT, on the sentiment analysis task.

- **Feature 3: Manual Fine-Tuning**  
    - **File:** `manual-finetune.py`  
        This script allows for manual fine-tuning of pre-trained models to improve their performance on specific datasets.

- **Feature 4: Random Data Selection**  
    - **File:** `random-selection-script.py`  
        This script selects random subsets of data to be labelled for finetuning.

- **Feature 5: Hyperparameter Optimization**  
    - **File:** `hyper-finetune.py`  
        This script performs hyperparameter tuning to optimize the performance of the machine learning models.

- **Feature 6: Confusion Matrix Analysis**  
    - **File:** `confuson-matrix.py`  
        This script generates confusion matrices to evaluate the classification performance of the models, providing insights into their accuracy and error rates.
